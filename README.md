# Snake Game in Terminal

This is a simple terminal-based snake game developed using C++.

## Requirements

The game uses the following libraries:
- `windows.h`
- `iostream`
- `map`
- `cstdlib`
- `thread`
- `chrono`
- `random`
- `ctime`

Note: This program is only compatible with Windows because it uses the `Windows.h` library.

## Features

- A terminal-based interface with a menu and gameplay screen.
- The ability to control the snakeâ€™s movement using keyboard inputs.
- A basic game loop with frame updates.
- Snake body design added and functioning correctly.
- Player speed and game frame rate adjusted for smoother gameplay (**TODO: Frame rate and player speed issues need further adjustments**).

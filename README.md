# Snake Game in Terminal

This is a simple terminal-based snake game developed using C++.

## Requirements

The game uses the following libraries:
- `windows.h`
- `iostream`
- `map`
- `cstdlib`
- `thread`
- `chrono`
- `random`
- `ctime`

Note: This program is only compatible with Windows because it uses the `Windows.h` library.

## Features

- A terminal-based interface with a menu and gameplay screen.
- The ability to control the snake’s movement using keyboard inputs.
- A basic game loop with frame updates.

## Limitations

This program is not fully completed. Specifically, I was unable to design the snake’s body.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions or can help with the design of the snake’s body, I would appreciate it if you could submit a pull request (PR).

## How to Compile and Run

1. Make sure you are on a Windows machine.
2. Install a C++ compiler (such as MinGW or Visual Studio).
3. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable to play the game in the terminal.
